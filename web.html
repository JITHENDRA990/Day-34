                <p>Organic farming, also known as organic agriculture or ecological farming or biological farming,[1][2][3][4][5] is<br>
                an agricultural system that uses fertilizers of organic origin such as compost manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting.
                <br> It originated early in the 20th century in reaction to rapidly changing farming practices. Indeed, so-called "organic pioneers" wanted to keep farming with nature, without being dependent on external inputs.<br>
                Certified organic agriculture accounts for 70 million hectares (170 million acres) globally, with over half of that total in Australia.<br>
                [6] Biological pest control, mixed cropping, and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged.<br>
                Organic standards are designed to allow the use of naturally-occurring substances while prohibiting or severely limiting synthetic substances.<br>
                [7] For instance, naturally-occurring pesticides such as garlic extract, bicarbonate of soda, or pyrethrin which is found naturally in the Chrysanthemum flower are permitted, while synthetic fertilizers and pesticides such as glyphosate are prohibited. Synthetic substances that are allowed, only in exceptional circumstances, include, for example, copper sulfate, elemental sulfur, and veterinary drugs. Genetically modified organisms, nanomaterials, human sewage sludge, plant growth regulators, hormones, and antibiotic use in livestock husbandry are prohibited.<br>
                [8][9] Organic farming positively impacts sustainability,[10][11] self-sufficiency, autonomy and independence,[11] health, animal welfare, food security, and food safety. <br>
                Organic farming can therefore be seen as part of the solution to the impacts of climate change, as also established by the Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).<br>
